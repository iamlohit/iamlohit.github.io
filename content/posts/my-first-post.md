As a network engineer with over 14 years of experience, I have seen a lot of changes in the field of networking. 
From the rise of cloud computing and virtualization, to the advent of software-defined networking and automation, 
the world of networking is constantly evolving.

One of the biggest trends in networking today is the shift towards cloud-based, software-defined networks. This 
allows for greater flexibility, scalability, and reliability in network design and engineering.

Another trend is the use of automation and machine learning to improve network performance and reliability. By 
automating routine tasks and using machine learning algorithms to analyze network data, network engineers can more 
effectively manage and optimize their networks.

In this blog, I will be sharing my experiences and insights on the latest trends in networking, including network 
design, network engineering, cloud networking, automation, software-defined networking, and network reliability. I 
hope you find my posts useful and informative.
