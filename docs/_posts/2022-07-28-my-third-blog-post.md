Sticking with First Principles,

    Q. How can engineers engage with the complexity involved in Data Transport Systems?
    A. - 1. Understand the basic problems and their various possible solutions.
        2. Build Models that aid engineers in understanding of transport protocols by:
            - Classifying Protocols by: Purpose, Information in each Protocol and interaction between protocols.
            - Help chose which questions to ask to understand a given protcol, what problems all protocols need to solve.
            -
